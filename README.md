My name is Gaurav Senthil Kumar

I am interested in studying the effects of metal evolution in the first galaxies to ever form. Currently I am seeking to answer 3 science questions:

1) What are LRDS?
2) Have we missed Strontium in DLA absorption spectra?
3) Tracing the evolution of PopIII and PopII stars in ISM of high-z galaxies

Finally I am building two radio telescopes at Niels Bohr Institute for observational astrophysics course.
